# Standalone Facts About Atoms
## Source: Wikipedia - Atom

### Basic Definition and Structure

- Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements and the fundamental building blocks of matter.
- An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons.
- Chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons in their atoms.
- Any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper.
- Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element.

### Size and Scale

- Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across.
- A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide.
- Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes.
- The smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225 pm.
- A single drop of water contains about 2 sextillion (2 x 10^21) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.
- A single carat diamond with a mass of 2 x 10^-4 kg contains about 10 sextillion (10^22) atoms of carbon.

### Mass Distribution

- More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.
- Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge, so the nucleus is positively charged.
- The electrons are negatively charged, and this opposing charge is what binds them to the nucleus.

### Subatomic Particles

- The electron has a mass of 9.11 x 10^-31 kg.
- Protons have a positive charge and a mass of 1.6726 x 10^-27 kg.
- Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a mass of 1.6749 x 10^-27 kg.
- The electron is the least massive of these particles by four orders of magnitude.
- Neutrons and protons have comparable dimensions—on the order of 2.5 x 10^-15 m.

### Nuclear Properties

- The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 x (cube root of A) femtometres, where A is the total number of nucleons.
- This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10^5 fm.

### Atomic Composition

- In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure, whereas protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks.
- Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +2/3) and one down quark (with a charge of -1/3).
- Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks.

### Stability and Isotopes

- About 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth, of which 251 (about 74%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "stable isotopes".
- Only 90 nuclides are stable theoretically.
- An additional 35 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 100 million years.
- For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists.
- The average is 3.1 stable isotopes per element.
- Twenty-six "monoisotopic elements" have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin.
- Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.

### Special Isotopes

- Only four known stable nuclides have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10, and nitrogen-14.
- Hydrogen-1 (the lightest isotope of hydrogen) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 Da.
- The heaviest stable atom is lead-208, with a mass of 207.9766521 Da.

### Energy Levels

- It requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus.

### Atomic Mass and Moles

- One dalton is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately 1.66 x 10^-27 kg.
- One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 6.022 x 10^23).
- Each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.

### Cosmic Context

- Baryonic matter forms about 4% of the total energy density of the observable universe, with an average density of about 0.25 particles/m^3 (mostly protons and electrons).
- Within the Milky Way, particles in the interstellar medium (ISM) range from 10^5 to 10^9 atoms/m^3.
- The Sun is believed to be inside the Local Bubble, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 10^3 atoms/m^3.
- Up to 95% of the Milky Way's baryonic matter are concentrated inside stars.

### Formation History

- Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the Big Bang.
- In about three minutes Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium, lithium, and deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.
- Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000 years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination.

### Earth's Atomic Composition

- The Earth contains approximately 1.33 x 10^50 atoms.
- At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including water, salt, silicates, and oxides.
- 99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen.
- About 99% of the helium in the crust of the Earth is a product of alpha decay.

### Historical Discoveries

- In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered that cathode rays are made of electrically charged particles with negative charge.
- Thomson measured these particles to be 1,700 times lighter than hydrogen (the lightest atom).
- In 1913, Henry Moseley discovered that the frequencies of X-ray emissions from an excited atom were a mathematical function of its atomic number and hydrogen's nuclear charge.
- In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the neutron.

### Antimatter

- The positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton.
- When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other.
- In 1996, the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.

### Element Distribution

- The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single-proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson.
- All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.

### Nuclear Forces

- The electromagnetic force binds electrons to the nucleus.
- The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force.
- The nuclear force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another.
- The strong force acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.

### Charged Atoms (Ions)

- A charged atom is called an ion.
- If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative charge and is called a negative ion (or anion).
- If it has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a positive ion (or cation).

### Helium Discovery

- Helium was discovered in the spectrum of the Sun 23 years before it was found on Earth.
