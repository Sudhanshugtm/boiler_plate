## 1. What is an Atom?

**Definition**: Atoms are the basic particles of chemical elements and the fundamental building blocks of matter.

**Structure**: An atom consists of:
- A **nucleus** made of protons and generally neutrons
- An electromagnetically bound swarm of **electrons** surrounding the nucleus

**Distinguishing Elements**: Chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons in their atoms. For example:
- Any atom with 11 protons is sodium
- Any atom with 29 protons is copper

**Isotopes**: Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element.

---

## 2. Size and Scale

**Extremely Small**: Atoms are typically around 100 picometers across.
- A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide
- Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light
- Humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes

**Quantum Effects**: Atoms are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects.

---

## 3. Mass Distribution

**Concentrated in Nucleus**: More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.
- Protons have positive electric charge
- Neutrons have no charge
- The nucleus is positively charged overall

---

## 4. Electric Charge

**Neutral Atoms**: If the numbers of protons and electrons are equal (as they normally are), the atom is electrically neutral as a whole.

**Ions**: A charged atom is called an ion.
- **Negative ion (anion)**: Has more electrons than protons (overall negative charge)
- **Positive ion (cation)**: Has more protons than electrons (overall positive charge)

---

## 5. Subatomic Particles

### Electrons
- **Least massive** of the three constituent particles (9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg)
- **Negative electrical charge**
- Size too small to be measured using available techniques
- Bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic force
- Were the lightest particle with positive rest mass measured until discovery of neutrino mass

### Protons
- **Positive charge**
- **Mass**: 1.6726 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
- The number of protons in an atom is called its **atomic number**
- Discovered by Ernest Rutherford (1919)
- Named "proton" in 1920

### Neutrons
- **No electrical charge**
- **Mass**: 1.6749 × 10⁻²⁷ kg (heaviest of the three particles)
- Mass can be reduced by nuclear binding energy
- Discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick
- Neutrons and protons collectively known as **nucleons**

### Particle Composition (Standard Model)
- **Electrons**: Truly elementary particles with no internal structure
- **Protons and Neutrons**: Composite particles made of quarks
  - Protons: 2 up quarks (charge +2/3 each) and 1 down quark (charge -1/3)
  - Neutrons: 1 up quark and 2 down quarks
- **Forces**: Quarks held together by strong interaction mediated by gluons

## 6. The Atomic Nucleus

**Definition**: All bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up the atomic nucleus.

**Size**: The radius of a nucleus is approximately 1.07∛A femtometers, where A is the total number of nucleons.
- Much smaller than the radius of the atom (order of 10⁵ fm)

**Binding Forces**:
- **Residual strong force**: Binds nucleons together (short-ranged attractive potential)
- At distances smaller than 2.5 fm, this force is much more powerful than electrostatic force
- Overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons

**Atomic Number and Isotopes**:
- Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons (atomic number)
- Within a single element, neutron numbers may vary (determining isotope)
- Total protons + neutrons determine the nuclide
- Neutron-to-proton ratio determines nucleus stability

**Nuclear Reactions**:
- **Nuclear fusion**: Multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus
- **Nuclear fission**: Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei
- Changing the number of protons transforms the atom into a different chemical element

---

## 7. Electron Cloud and Atomic Orbitals

**Electromagnetic Binding**: Electrons are attracted to protons in the nucleus by electromagnetic force.

**Energy Well**: Electrons are bound inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the nucleus.
- Closer electrons require more energy to escape
- External energy source needed for electron to escape

**Wave-Particle Duality**: Electrons have properties of both a particle and a wave.

**Atomic Orbitals**:
- A region where each electron forms a three-dimensional standing wave
- Characterized by a mathematical function describing the probability of finding an electron at a particular location
- Only discrete (quantized) sets of orbitals exist around the nucleus
- Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures
- Differ in size, shape, and orientation

**Energy Levels**:
- Each orbital corresponds to a particular energy level
- Electrons can change states by absorbing photons (moving to higher energy)
- Electrons can emit photons through spontaneous emission (dropping to lower energy)
- Energy differences between quantum states are responsible for atomic spectral lines

---

## 8. Nuclear Properties and Isotopes

**Element Definition**: Any two atoms with an identical number of protons belong to the same chemical element.

**Isotopes**: Atoms with equal protons but different neutrons are different isotopes of the same element.
- Example: All hydrogen atoms have exactly one proton
  - Hydrogen-1 (protium): no neutrons (most common)
  - Deuterium: one neutron
  - Tritium: two neutrons

**Stable Isotopes**: About 251 nuclides have not been observed to decay and are referred to as "stable isotopes"
- Only 90 are stable theoretically
- Another 161 have not been observed to decay even though it's energetically possible

**Radioactivity**: All elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 (lead) are radioactive.

---

## 9. Atomic Mass

**Mass Number**: The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in an atom
- A positive integer and dimensionless
- Example: "carbon-12" has 12 nucleons (6 protons + 6 neutrons)

**Atomic Mass Unit**: Actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed in daltons (Da) or unified atomic mass units (u)
- Defined as 1/12 of the mass of a free neutral carbon-12 atom
- Approximately 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg

**Mass Relationship**: A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the dalton.

---

## 10. Atomic Size and Shape

**Atomic Radius**: Since atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, dimensions are described in terms of atomic radius.
- Measure of distance to which electron cloud extends from nucleus
- Assumes spherical shape (only true for atoms in vacuum or free space)

**Size Range**:
- **Smallest**: Helium with radius of 32 picometers
- **Largest**: Caesium at 225 picometers

**Periodic Trends**:
- Atom size tends to increase when moving down columns
- Atom size tends to decrease when moving across rows (left to right)

**Shape Deformation**: When subjected to external forces (electrical fields), atom shape may deviate from spherical symmetry.

---

## 11. Radioactive Decay

**Instability**: Every element has one or more isotopes with unstable nuclei subject to radioactive decay.
- Nucleus emits particles or electromagnetic radiation
- Occurs when nucleus radius is large compared to strong force radius

**Common Forms**:

1. **Alpha decay**: Nucleus emits alpha particle (helium nucleus with 2 protons + 2 neutrons)
   - Results in new element with lower atomic number

2. **Beta decay**: Regulated by weak force
   - Neutron transforms to proton (emits electron + antineutrino)
   - Proton transforms to neutron (emits positron + neutrino)
   - Changes atomic number by one

3. **Gamma decay**: Results from energy level change in nucleus
   - Emits electromagnetic radiation
   - Usually follows alpha or beta decay

**Half-Life**: The characteristic time period for half of a radioactive sample to decay.
- Exponential decay process
- After two half-lives, only 25% of isotope remains

---

## 12. Magnetic Properties

**Spin**: Elementary particles possess intrinsic quantum mechanical property called spin.
- Electrons, protons, and neutrons all have spin 1/2 ℏ

**Magnetic Moment**: Produced by various forms of angular momentum.
- Electron spin provides most dominant contribution

**Electron Pairing**: In atoms, electrons pair up with opposite spins.
- One electron in spin-up state, one in spin-down state
- Spins cancel out, reducing total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms

**Ferromagnetism**: In elements like iron, cobalt, and nickel:
- Odd number of electrons leads to unpaired electron
- Net overall magnetic moment
- Spins align through exchange interaction
- Can produce measurable macroscopic magnetic field

## 13. Energy Levels and Spectra

**Every element in the universe has a unique light fingerprint** - this is how we know what distant stars are made of, billions of light-years away.

**Quantized Energy**: The potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative relative to when distance from nucleus goes to infinity.
- Bound electron can occupy only a set of discrete quantum states centered on nucleus
- Each state corresponds to a specific energy level
- Think of it like rungs on a ladder - electrons can only stand on specific steps, never in between

**Ground State**: The lowest energy state of a bound electron (stationary state).

**Excited State**: Results from electron transition to a higher energy level.

**Photon Interactions**:
- Electron absorbs photon → transitions to higher energy state
- Electron emits photon → drops to lower energy state
- Photon energy must match the energy difference between states
- This is why neon signs glow specific colors - electrons in neon atoms emit red-orange light when they drop back down

**Spectral Lines**:
- Characteristic energy values create atomic spectral lines
- Each element has a characteristic spectrum
- Allows identification of elements by their unique spectral signature
- **Key Point**: Spectroscopy lets us analyze the chemical composition of distant stars by examining their light - we can identify elements millions of miles away without ever touching them

**Absorption and Emission**:
- Continuous spectrum passing through gas → atoms absorb specific photons
- Creates dark absorption bands
- Atoms spontaneously emit photons in random directions
- Creates emission lines when observed

**Real-World Examples**:
- Neon signs emit characteristic red-orange light when electricity excites neon atoms
- Fireworks get their colors from specific elements: strontium (red), barium (green), copper (blue)
- Sodium street lamps produce their distinctive yellow glow from sodium's unique spectral lines
- The Sun's spectrum reveals it contains hydrogen, helium, iron, and many other elements

**Fun Fact**: Helium was discovered in the Sun's spectrum 23 years before it was found on Earth. Scientists analyzing sunlight in 1868 saw spectral lines that didn't match any known element, so they named the mystery element "helium" after Helios, the Greek god of the Sun. It wasn't until 1895 that helium was finally isolated on Earth.

## 14. Chemical Bonding

**Valence**: The combining power of an element determined by number of bonds it can form.

**Valence Shell**: The outermost electron shell in an atom's uncombined state.

**Valence Electrons**: Electrons in the valence shell.
- Determine bonding behavior with other atoms
- Atoms tend to chemically react to fill (or empty) their outer valence shells

**Bond Formation**:
- Electrons farthest from nucleus may be transferred to other atoms
- Or shared between atoms
- Enables atoms to bond into molecules and other chemical compounds

**Periodic Table Organization**:
- Elements with same number of valence electrons form a group (aligned in same column)
- Horizontal rows correspond to filling of quantum shell of electrons
- Elements at far right have completely filled outer shells → noble gases (chemically inert)

---

## 15. Forces Within Atoms

**Electromagnetic Force**:
- Attracts electrons to protons in nucleus
- Binds electrons to the atom

**Nuclear Force**:
- Attracts protons and neutrons to each other in nucleus
- Usually stronger than electromagnetic force repelling protons from each other
- When electromagnetic force becomes stronger, nucleus can split (nuclear fission/decay)

**Binding Energy**:
- Energy needed for nucleon to escape the nucleus
- If fusion reaction mass is less than sum of separate particle masses, difference is emitted as energy
- Described by Einstein's E = mc²
- Part of binding energy of new nucleus

---

## 16. Origin of Atoms

**Electrons**: Thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the Big Bang.

**Big Bang Nucleosynthesis**: In about three minutes, produced most of the:
- Helium
- Lithium
- Deuterium in the Universe
- Perhaps some beryllium and boron

**Stellar Nucleosynthesis**: Since the Big Bang, atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through nuclear fusion:
- Produces helium from hydrogen
- Via triple-alpha process: creates carbon through iron

**Heavy Elements**:
- Elements heavier than iron produced in:
  - Supernovae (r-process)
  - Colliding neutron stars (r-process)
  - AGB stars (s-process)
- Both processes involve neutron capture by atomic nuclei

**Earth's Atoms**: Most atoms making up Earth and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed to form the Solar System.

6. **Atoms interact through their electrons**, particularly valence electrons, enabling chemical bonding and the formation of molecules.

7. **Quantum mechanics is essential** for understanding atomic behavior, as atoms are too small for classical physics to apply.

8. **All atoms originated from cosmic processes**: Big Bang nucleosynthesis created light elements, while stellar processes created heavier elements.
