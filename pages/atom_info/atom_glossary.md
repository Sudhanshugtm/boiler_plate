**Antihydrogen**: The antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom, synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva in 1996.

**Atom**: The basic particles of the chemical elements and the fundamental building blocks of matter. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons.
