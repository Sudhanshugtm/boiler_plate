## Early Philosophical Foundations

### Maharashi Kanād (India, ~600 BCE)
- Proposed atomic theory dating back to 2600 years from India
- Introduced the concept of 'paramanu' (lit. the smallest particle of matter) as atom
- Used the example of rice ground into fine powder to illustrate that matter reaches a stage where it cannot be divided further
- Though not exact in modern sense, his theory somewhat aligns with Dalton's theory

## Modern Atomic Theory Pioneers

### John Dalton (Early 19th Century)

**Law of Multiple Proportions (Early 1800s):**
- Compiled experimental data and discovered the "law of multiple proportions"
- Observed that in chemical compounds containing two elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B differs by ratios of small whole numbers
- Applied the word "atom" to discrete units of matter based on evidence

**Experimental Work:**
- Analyzed tin oxides (grey: 88.1% tin, 11.9% oxygen; white: 78.7% tin, 21.3% oxygen)
- Concluded grey oxide = SnO, white oxide = SnO₂
- Analyzed iron oxides (black: 78.1% iron, 21.9% oxygen; red: 70.4% iron, 29.6% oxygen)
- Identified these as iron(II) oxide (FeO) and iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃)
- Studied nitrogen oxides (nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide) establishing 1:2:4 oxygen ratios

## Discovery of Subatomic Particles

### J. J. Thomson (1897-1907)

**Discovery of the Electron (1897):**
- Discovered that cathode rays can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields
- Determined cathode rays are electrically charged particles with negative charge
- Measured these particles to be 1,700 times lighter than hydrogen
- Called these particles "corpuscles" (later renamed "electrons")
- Showed electrons were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials
- Explained electric current as the passing of electrons from one atom to the next
- Concluded atoms were not indivisible but composed of electrons whose negative charge was balanced by positive charge

**Additional Contributions:**
- In 1898, found that the positive charge of a hydrogen ion equals the negative charge of an electron
- Found that positive charge in an atom is a positive multiple of an electron's negative charge
- Proposed the "plum pudding model" (though he didn't use this term) - electrons distributed throughout a sphere of positive charge

---

### William Prout (1815)
- Observed that atomic weights of many elements were multiples of hydrogen's atomic weight
- This observation is true for all elements when isotopes are taken into account

---

### Henry Moseley (1913)
- Discovered that frequencies of X-ray emissions from an excited atom were a mathematical function of its atomic number and hydrogen's nuclear charge

---

### Ernest Rutherford (1908-1920)

**Discovery of the Nucleus (1908-1913):**
- Along with colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, performed scattering experiments
- Bombarded thin metal foils with alpha particles
- Observed some alpha particles deflected by angles greater than 90°
- Proposed that positive charge of atom is concentrated in a tiny volume at the center (nucleus)
- Concluded nucleus carried almost all of the atom's mass
- This nucleus model replaced Thomson's plum pudding model

**Discovery of the Proton (1919-1920):**
- In 1919, bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles
- Detected hydrogen ions being emitted from the gas
- Concluded hydrogen nucleus is a singular particle with positive charge equal to electron's negative charge
- Named this particle "proton" in 1920
- Introduced the concept of "atomic number" (number of protons in an atom)
- Found atomic number equals element's ordinal number on periodic table
- Hypothesized surplus atomic weight was carried by unknown neutral particles with mass equal to proton

### Hans Geiger (1908-1913)
- Colleague of Ernest Rutherford
- Participated in alpha particle scattering experiments that led to discovery of the atomic nucleus

---

### Ernest Marsden (1908-1913)
- Colleague of Ernest Rutherford
- Participated in alpha particle scattering experiments that led to discovery of the atomic nucleus

---

### Niels Bohr (1913)

**Bohr Model:**
- In 1913, proposed a new model addressing classical mechanics problems
- Electrons orbit the nucleus in a finite set of orbits
- Electrons can only jump between orbits in discrete changes of energy
- Energy changes correspond to absorption or radiation of a photon
- Explained why electrons' orbits are stable
- Explained why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra
- Model could only predict emission spectra of hydrogen, not atoms with more electrons

---

### Walter Bothe (1928)
- Observed that beryllium emitted highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles
- This radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax
- Initially thought to be high-energy gamma radiation

---

### James Chadwick (1932)

**Discovery of the Neutron:**
- Found the ionization effect of beryllium radiation was too strong to be electromagnetic radiation
- In 1932, exposed various elements (hydrogen, nitrogen) to "beryllium radiation"
- Measured energies of recoiling charged particles
- Deduced radiation was composed of electrically neutral particles
- These particles were not massless but had mass similar to a proton
- Claimed these particles as Rutherford's predicted neutrons

## Quantum Mechanics Era

### Werner Heisenberg (1925-1927)

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- In 1925, published first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics)
- In 1927, formulated the uncertainty principle
- Showed it's mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both position and momentum of a particle simultaneously
- For given accuracy in measuring position, one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa

---

### Louis de Broglie (1924)
- One year before Heisenberg's formulation, proposed that all particles behave like waves to some extent
- This wave-particle duality concept influenced development of quantum mechanics

---

### Erwin Schrödinger (1926)

**Schrödinger Equation:**
- In 1926, used de Broglie's wave concept to develop the Schrödinger equation
- Equation describes electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than points in space
- Led to modern understanding of atomic orbitals
- Model explained atomic behavior that previous models could not, including structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen

## Additional Scientists Mentioned

### Albert Einstein
- His mass-energy equivalence formula (E = mc²) explained energy release in nuclear reactions
- Mass loss in nuclear reactions can be emitted as energy (gamma rays, kinetic energy of beta particles)
- This energy is part of the binding energy of the nucleus

## Key Concepts Established

1. **Atomic Structure**: Atoms consist of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons
2. **Atomic Number**: Number of protons determines the element's identity
3. **Isotopes**: Atoms with same protons but different neutrons
4. **Quantum Mechanics**: Electrons exist in probability clouds (orbitals) rather than fixed orbits
5. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties
6. **Uncertainty Principle**: Cannot simultaneously know exact position and momentum of particles
