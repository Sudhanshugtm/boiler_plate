## Ancient Philosophy

**2600 years ago (India)**: Maharashi Kanād proposed an early atomic theory in India. He described 'paramanu' (literally "the smallest particle of matter") as the atom. He used the example of rice - when ground into a fine powder, a stage is reached where it cannot be ground further. Though not the exact modern meaning of atom, it somewhat aligns with later atomic theories.

**Ancient Greece**: The word "atom" derives from the ancient Greek word "atomos," which means "uncuttable." However, this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old philosophical concepts.

## Early Scientific Era

**1815**: William Prout observed that the atomic weights of many elements were multiples of hydrogen's atomic weight, which is true for all elements if isotopes are taken into account.

## Early 19th Century - Dalton's Atomic Theory

**Early 1800s**: John Dalton compiled experimental data and discovered the "law of multiple proportions." He noticed that in chemical compounds containing two particular elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B differs by ratios of small whole numbers. This suggested that each element combines with others in multiples of a basic unit of weight. Dalton applied the word "atom" to these discrete units of matter.

**1808**: John Dalton published "A New System of Chemical Philosophy," documenting his atomic theory and providing examples of atoms and molecules.

Dalton's key findings:
- Analyzed tin oxides: showed ratios of 1:2 for oxygen atoms per tin atom
- Analyzed iron oxides: showed ratios of 2:3 for oxygen atoms per iron atoms
- Analyzed nitrogen oxides: showed ratios of 1:2:4 for oxygen content

## Late 19th Century - Discovery of Subatomic Particles

**1897**: J.J. Thomson discovered that cathode rays can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields, proving they are electrically charged particles (not light). He measured these particles to be 1,700 times lighter than hydrogen. He called them "corpuscles" but they were later renamed "electrons."

Thomson showed that:
- Electrons were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials
- Electric current is the passing of electrons from one atom to the next
- Atoms were not indivisible - they contained electrons whose negative charge was balanced by positive charge
- Ions are atoms with excess or shortage of electrons

**1898**: J.J. Thomson found that the positive charge of a hydrogen ion equals the negative charge of an electron, and these were the smallest known charged particles at the time.

Thomson later found that the positive charge in an atom is a positive multiple of an electron's negative charge.

**Thomson's Model**: Thomson proposed that positive charge was distributed everywhere in the atom (sphere shape), with electrons distributed throughout in an even manner. This is popularly known as the "plum pudding model," though Thomson himself never used this analogy. This model was incomplete and couldn't predict emission spectra or valencies.

## Early 20th Century - Nuclear Model

**1908-1913**: Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger, and Ernest Marsden performed scattering experiments by bombarding thin metal foils with alpha particles. They observed alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which shouldn't have been possible according to Thomson's model.

Rutherford proposed:
- The positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny volume at the center (nucleus)
- Electrons surround this nucleus in a diffuse cloud
- The nucleus carries almost all the atom's mass
- Only such an intense concentration of charge could deflect alpha particles so strongly

**1913**: Niels Bohr proposed a new model where electrons orbit the nucleus in a finite set of orbits. Electrons could only jump between orbits in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization explained why electrons' orbits are stable and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra. However, Bohr's model could only predict the emission spectra of hydrogen, not atoms with more than one electron.

**1913**: Henry Moseley discovered that the frequencies of X-ray emissions from an excited atom were a mathematical function of its atomic number and hydrogen's nuclear charge.

**1919**: Ernest Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and detected hydrogen ions being emitted. He concluded that alpha particles were hitting and splitting the nuclei of nitrogen atoms. These observations led Rutherford to conclude that the hydrogen nucleus is a singular particle with positive charge equal to the electron's negative charge.

**1920**: Rutherford named the hydrogen nucleus particle "proton." The number of protons in an atom (the "atomic number") was found to equal the element's ordinal number on the periodic table. Rutherford hypothesized that surplus atomic weight was carried by unknown particles with no electric charge and mass equal to the proton.

## Discovery of the Neutron

**1928**: Walter Bothe observed that beryllium emitted highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. This radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax.

**1932**: James Chadwick exposed various elements (hydrogen, nitrogen) to the "beryllium radiation." By measuring the energies of recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was composed of electrically neutral particles that were not massless (like gamma rays) but instead had mass similar to a proton. Chadwick claimed these particles as Rutherford's predicted neutrons.

## Quantum Mechanical Era

**1924**: Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles behave like waves to some extent.

**1925**: Werner Heisenberg published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics).

**1926**: Erwin Schrödinger developed the Schrödinger equation, which describes electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than points in space.

**1927**: Werner Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty principle. Using waveforms to describe particles means it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time. For a given accuracy in measuring position, one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.

**The Current Consensus Model**: The planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be found. This model explained observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen.
