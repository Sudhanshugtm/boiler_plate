# Atomic Structure and Components
## Source: Wikipedia - Atom

## Overview

An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton, and the neutron.

More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms.

## Subatomic Particles

### Electrons

- **Mass**: 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg (the least massive of the three constituent particles by four orders of magnitude)
- **Charge**: Negative electrical charge
- **Size**: Too small to be measured using available techniques
- **Properties**:
  - In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure
  - Was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of neutrino mass
  - Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges
  - Have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson

### Protons

- **Mass**: 1.6726 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
- **Charge**: Positive charge
- **Properties**:
  - The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number
  - Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei
  - By 1920, he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton
  - Protons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks
  - Composed of two up quarks (each with charge +⅔) and one down quark (with a charge of −⅓)

### Neutrons

- **Mass**: 1.6749 × 10⁻²⁷ kg (the heaviest of the three constituent particles)
- **Charge**: No electrical charge
- **Properties**:
  - Their mass can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy
  - Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁵ m
  - The 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined
  - The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick
  - Neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks
  - Consist of one up quark and two down quarks

### Quarks and Forces

The quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties. The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.

## The Nucleus

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons.

### Nuclear Properties

- **Size**: The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 ∛A femtometres, where A is the total number of nucleons
- **Comparison**: This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10⁵ fm
- **Binding Force**: The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force
- **Force Strength**: At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other

### Nuclear Composition and Stability

- Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number
- Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element
- The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide
- The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay

### Quantum Mechanics of the Nucleus

- The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions
- Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time
- Every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud

### Nuclear Stability and Decay

- A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match
- Atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay
- With increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus

### Nuclear Reactions

**Nuclear Fusion**:
- Occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei
- At the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3 to 10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus

**Nuclear Fission**:
- The opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay
- The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons
- If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element

**Binding Energy**:
- If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle)
- Described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E = mc², where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light
- This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate

**Energy Release**:
- The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together
- This energy-releasing process makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction
- For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon begins to decrease
- A fusion process producing a nucleus that has an atomic number higher than about 26, and a mass number higher than about 60, is an endothermic process
- More massive nuclei cannot undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star

## The Electron Cloud

The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus.

### Electron Behavior and Binding

- An external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape
- The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force
- Electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations

### Wave-Particle Duality

- Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave
- The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus

### Atomic Orbitals

- This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured
- Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form
- Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation

### Energy Levels and Transitions

- Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron
- The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state
- Through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon
- These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines

### Electron Binding Energy

- The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the electron binding energy—is far less than the binding energy of nucleons
- Example: It requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus

### Electrical Neutrality and Ions

- Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons
- Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions
- If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative charge and is called a negative ion (or anion)
- If it has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a positive ion (or cation)

### Chemical Bonding

- Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms
- By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals

## Forces Holding the Atom Together

### Electromagnetic Force
- The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force
- This is the force that binds electrons to the nucleus

### Nuclear Force
- The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force
- This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another
- Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, causing the nucleus to split and leave behind different elements (nuclear fission/decay)
