# Atomic Properties and Behaviors
## Source: Wikipedia - Atom

## Basic Atomic Structure and Charge Behavior

Atoms consist of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.

**Electrical Charge Properties:**
- Protons have a positive electric charge
- Neutrons have no electrical charge (neutral)
- Electrons have a negative electric charge
- The nucleus is positively charged (due to protons)
- The opposing charges between electrons (negative) and nucleus (positive) bind the electrons to the nucleus
- When protons and electrons are equal in number, the atom is electrically neutral
- A charged atom is called an **ion**
  - If an atom has more electrons than protons, it has an overall negative charge and is called a **negative ion (anion)**
  - If an atom has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a **positive ion (cation)**

## Electromagnetic Forces and Nuclear Behavior

**Electromagnetic Force:**
- Electrons are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force
- This force binds electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the nucleus
- The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force
- External energy is needed for an electron to escape the potential well
- Electrons bound near the center require more energy to escape than those at greater separations

**Nuclear Force:**
- Protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force
- The nuclear force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels positively charged protons from one another
- Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force
- When this happens, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements - this is a form of **nuclear decay** (nuclear fission)

## Chemical Bonding and Attachment

Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by **chemical bonds** to form:
- Chemical compounds
- Molecules
- Crystals

**Bonding Mechanisms:**
- The ability of atoms to attach and detach from each other is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature
- Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus (valence electrons) may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms
- By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals
- Chemistry is the science that studies these changes

## Electron Behavior and Energy Levels

**Electron Cloud:**
- Electrons form a type of three-dimensional standing wave inside the potential well around the nucleus
- This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital - a mathematical function that characterizes the probability that an electron appears at a particular location
- Only a discrete (quantized) set of orbitals exist around the nucleus
- Other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into more stable forms
- Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ in size, shape, and orientation

**Energy Transitions:**
- Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron
- An electron can change its state to a higher energy level by **absorbing a photon** with sufficient energy
- Through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while **radiating the excess energy as a photon**
- These characteristic energy values are responsible for atomic spectral lines

**Electron Binding Energy:**
- The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron (electron binding energy) is far less than the binding energy of nucleons
- For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus

## Valence and Bonding Behavior

**Valency:**
- Valency is the combining power of an element
- It is determined by the number of bonds an element can form to other atoms or groups
- The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the **valence shell**
- Electrons in the valence shell are called **valence electrons**
- The number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms

**Chemical Reactivity:**
- Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells
- A transfer of a single electron between atoms occurs for bonds between atoms with one electron more than a filled shell and atoms one electron short of a full shell (as in sodium chloride and other ionic salts)
- Many elements display multiple valences - tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds
- Chemical bonding between elements takes many forms of electron-sharing beyond simple electron transfers (as seen in carbon and organic compounds)

## States of Matter

Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on physical conditions such as temperature and pressure. By varying these conditions, materials can transition between:
- **Solids**
- **Liquids**
- **Gases**
- **Plasmas**

Within a state, a material can also exist in different **allotropes**. Examples:
- Solid carbon can exist as graphite or diamond
- Gaseous allotropes exist, such as dioxygen and ozone

**Extreme States:**
- At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a **Bose-Einstein condensate**
- At this point, quantum mechanical effects normally only observed at the atomic scale become apparent on a macroscopic scale
- This super-cooled collection of atoms behaves as a single super atom

## Radioactive Decay

Every element has one or more isotopes with unstable nuclei subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation.

**Common Forms of Radioactive Decay:**

1. **Alpha Decay:**
   - The nucleus emits an alpha particle (a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons)
   - Results in a new element with a lower atomic number

2. **Beta Decay (and electron capture):**
   - Regulated by the weak force
   - Results from transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron
   - Neutron to proton transition: accompanied by emission of an electron and an antineutrino
   - Proton to neutron transition: causes emission of a positron and a neutrino (except in electron capture)
   - Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number by one
   - In electron capture, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus rather than a positron being emitted

3. **Gamma Decay:**
   - Results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state
   - Results in emission of electromagnetic radiation
   - Usually occurs following emission of an alpha or beta particle

**Other Decay Types:**
- Ejection of neutrons or protons
- Ejection of clusters of nucleons from a nucleus
- Emission of more than one beta particle
- Internal conversion (produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays)
- Spontaneous nuclear fission (large nuclei explode into charged fragments and neutrons)

**Half-Life:**
- Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period called the half-life
- This is the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay
- This is an exponential decay process
- After two half-lives, only 25% of the isotope remains

## Nuclear Properties and Isotopes

**Isotopes:**
- Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element
- The total number of protons and neutrons determines the nuclide
- The number of neutrons relative to protons determines the stability of the nucleus
- Certain isotopes undergo radioactive decay

**Stability Factors:**
- The ratio of protons to neutrons affects isotope stability
- The presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons represents closed and filled quantum shells, conferring unusual stability
- Atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay
- With increasing atomic number, mutual repulsion of protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain stability

**Nuclear Reactions:**

1. **Nuclear Fusion:**
   - Multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus
   - Occurs through energetic collision of two nuclei
   - Requires high energies to overcome mutual repulsion (coulomb barrier)
   - For lighter elements (atomic numbers less than iron and nickel), fusion is usually an exothermic process releasing more energy than required
   - This energy-releasing process makes nuclear fusion in stars self-sustaining

2. **Nuclear Fission:**
   - The opposite of fusion
   - A nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei
   - Usually occurs through radioactive decay
   - Can be induced through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons
   - If the number of protons in a nucleus changes, the atom changes to a different chemical element

**Mass-Energy Relationship:**
- If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of masses of separate particles, the difference can be emitted as usable energy (gamma ray or kinetic energy of a beta particle)
- This follows Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula: E = mc²
- This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus

## Magnetic Moment

**Spin Properties:**
- Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property called **spin**
- Electrons, protons, and neutrons all have spin ½ ħ
- In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin
- The nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin

**Magnetic Field Production:**
- The magnetic field produced by an atom (its magnetic moment) is determined by various forms of angular momentum
- The most dominant contribution comes from electron spin
- Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, bound electrons pair up with one member in a spin up state and the other in spin down state
- These spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even numbers of electrons

**Ferromagnetism:**
- In ferromagnetic elements (iron, cobalt, nickel), an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment
- When orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap, a lower energy state is achieved when spins of unpaired electrons align - a spontaneous exchange interaction
- When magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field

**Paramagnetism:**
- Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present
- The magnetic moments of individual atoms line up in the presence of a field

## Atomic Size and Shape

**Size Properties:**
- Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary
- Dimensions are usually described in terms of atomic radius (distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus)
- Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across
- A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide
- Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light (humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes)
- Accurately predicting atomic behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects

**Size Variations:**
- On the periodic table, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns
- Atom size tends to decrease when moving across rows (left to right)
- The smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm
- One of the largest is caesium at 225 pm

**Shape Deformation:**
- When subjected to external forces like electrical fields, the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry
- The deformation depends on field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons
- Aspherical deviations can be elicited in crystals where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites

## Spectroscopic Behavior

**Spectral Lines:**
- When a continuous spectrum of energy passes through a gas or plasma, some photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change energy levels
- Excited electrons that remain bound spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and drop back to lower energy levels
- Atoms behave like a filter forming a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output
- An observer viewing atoms from a view not including the continuous spectrum background sees a series of emission lines from photons emitted by atoms
- Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow determination of composition and physical properties of a substance

**Fine Structure:**
- Some spectral lines display fine structure splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (interaction between spin and motion of the outermost electron)

**Field Effects:**
- **Zeeman Effect:** When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines split into three or more components due to interaction of the magnetic field with the atom's magnetic moment and electrons
- **Stark Effect:** Presence of an external electric field causes comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying electron energy levels

**Stimulated Emission:**
- If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with matching energy level
- The emitted photon and interacting photon move off in parallel with matching phases (synchronized wave patterns)
- This property is used to make lasers, which emit coherent beams of light energy in narrow frequency bands

## Quantum Mechanical Behavior

**Wave-Particle Duality:**
- Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave
- The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave
- This wave form does not move relative to the nucleus

**Uncertainty Principle:**
- It is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time
- For a given accuracy in measuring position, one can only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa

**Pauli Exclusion Principle:**
- Protons, electrons, and neutrons are classified as fermions
- Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state at the same time
- Every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons
- The same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud
